## MiniCPM-o

[**MiniCPM-o 4.5**](https://github.com/OpenBMB/MiniCPM-o) is a 9B-parameter on-device omni-modal large language model jointly developed by ModelBest and Tsinghua University, featuring powerful vision, speech, and full-duplex streaming capabilities.

## Omni Architecture & Runtime Mechanism

### Model Architecture

Built on the MiniCPM-o 4.5 end-to-end omni-modal architecture, where modality encoders/decoders are densely connected to the LLM through hidden states. This design enables better information flow and control while fully leveraging the rich multimodal knowledge acquired during training.

llama.cpp-omni splits the original PyTorch model into multiple independent GGUF modules, each with specific responsibilities:

- **VPM**: Vision encoder based on SigLip2 architecture, responsible for encoding images into visual embeddings. Includes a Resampler module that compresses visual features into a fixed number of query tokens before projecting them into the LLM's hidden space.
- **APM**: Audio encoder based on Whisper architecture, responsible for encoding 16kHz audio into audio embeddings. Features AvgPool and Projector layers to project into the LLM's hidden space.
- **LLM**: Main language model based on Qwen3-8B, which receives visual and audio embeddings as input and generates text token sequences. Supports multiple quantization formats (F16/Q8_0/Q4_K_M).
- **TTS**: Text-to-speech model based on LLaMA architecture, which projects LLM hidden states through Projector Semantic and autoregressively generates audio token sequences.
- **Token2Wav**: Flow Matching-based vocoder that converts audio tokens into 24kHz waveform audio.

### Full-Duplex Streaming Mechanism

llama.cpp-omni implements a full-duplex streaming mechanism where input streams (video + audio) and output streams (speech + text) operate without blocking each other:

- **Streaming Encoders**: Transforms offline modality encoders into online streaming versions for real-time input processing. Audio is sliced into 1-second chunks for APM, while images are fed frame-by-frame to VPM.
- **Time-Division Multiplexing (TDM)**: Within the LLM backbone, TDM divides parallel omni-modal streams into sequential information groups within periodic time slices, achieving millisecond-level input/output stream synchronization.
- **Interleaved Speech Generation**: The TTS module models text and speech tokens in an interleaved manner, supporting full-duplex speech generation where output can synchronize with new input in real-time while ensuring stability for long speech generation (>1 minute).

### Proactive Interaction Mechanism

In duplex mode, the LLM continuously monitors incoming video and audio streams, deciding whether to speak proactively at 1Hz frequency. This high-frequency decision-making capability, combined with full-duplex features, enables proactive interactions such as spontaneous reminders and comments.

### Runtime Pipeline

The core runtime pipeline of llama.cpp-omni consists of three stages:

1. **Initialization (omni_init)**: Loads all GGUF models, initializes LLM/TTS/Token2Wav contexts, and configures simplex/duplex mode along with reference audio (for voice cloning).

2. **Streaming Prefill (stream_prefill)**: 
   - When `index=0`: Initializes System Prompt, including text system prompt and audio system prompt (reference audio embedding)
   - When `index>0`: Processes user input — audio is encoded via APM, images via VPM, and embeddings are fed into LLM prefill
   - Supports high-resolution mode (max_slice_nums=2) and high-FPS mode (main image + stacked images)

3. **Streaming Decode (stream_decode)**:
   - LLM autoregressively generates text tokens, entering speech generation upon `<|speak|>` and switching to listening state upon `<|listen|>`
   - TTS projects LLM hidden states to generate audio tokens
   - Token2Wav synthesizes WAV audio in real-time using a sliding window approach (28 tokens input, 25 tokens stride)
   - All three modules execute in parallel via asynchronous queues, enabling streaming output
